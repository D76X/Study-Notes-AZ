# [Provisioning Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines (by Anthony Nocentino)](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-virtual-machines-provisioning/table-of-contents)  

## Basics

In order to make use of Azure you need the following.

1. An Azure user account **which uniquely identifies a user inside Microsoft Azure**. 
2. A **number of subscriptions** set up by an Azure Account **administrator Account**.#
3. Potentially other Microsoft User Accounts set up by the admin who gives access to Azure resources to them by assigning to them a corresponding pool of subscriptions. 

- The Azure user account is normally subjected to **an access policy** determined by an administrator which will determine which resources are accessible by the user, normally buy a set of **subscriptions**.

- A **subscriptions** grants access to Microsoft Azure resources and is **used for billing purposes** that is **any subscription is billed separately**.

- There exists a number of **subscription types**.  
    1. Azure free account.
    2. Pay-As-You-go.
    3. Microsoft Visual Studio Azure Subscription.
    4. Enterprise Agreements.

- **Resources** are always assigned to **subscriptions**.

## Resource Manager 

**The Resource Manager** allows to build **Resource Groups** and provides a **consistent management and tooling**. Furthermore, it allows for the creation of **Security boundary for role-based access control**.

**The Resource Manager** can also be leveraged to create **Billing grouping**. This scenario makes it possible to accurately monitor the costs of the **individual areas of the business** which each have access to their own pool of resources as a single **resource group**.

To summarise the role of the Resource Manger

- Build Resource Groups.
- Provide consistent managemnet and tooling.
- Build Billing Groups for individual Business Areas.
- Build Security Role-Based security boundaries.

## Regions

An **Azure Region** is a **set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined perimeter** which are **connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network**.

In summary an Azure Region presents the following parts.

- A set of data centers.
- The confine of a geografical area.
- A dedicated connecting low-latency netowrk.

## Availability Zone

An **Azure Availability Zone** is a **physically separate locations within an Azure Region**. Each Availability Zone is made of **one or more data centers**. Each Availability Zone is equipped with **individual power, cooling and networking**.

Withing an **Availability Zone** it is guaranteed to have **very low-latency**. In practice for any application with the requirement of **very high-performace** it is possible to deploy all resources within the same Availability Zone.

In summary Availability Zones have the following characteristics.

- Individual data centers within an Azure Region.
- Each datacenter within an Availabilty Zone has indipendent power, cooling and netwoking.
- Resources deployed within the same Availability Zone are garanteed to have very-low latency.
