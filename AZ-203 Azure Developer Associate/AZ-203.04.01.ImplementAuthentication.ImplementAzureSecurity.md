## [Microsoft Azure Authentication Scenarios for Developers by Sahil Malik](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers/table-of-contents) 

### [The limits of Active Direcory (AD)](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=81397afd-a564-4afd-826d-07968d4f5e4f&clip=1&mode=live)  

In the **Windows Ecosystem** **Authentication is implemented by means of the long standing Active Directory (AD)**. However, **AD does not scale well** in all cases that involves actors who might need to authenticate from outside the boundaries of the organization.

These cases have become predominant in all secotrs of industry. The list below shows a sample of typical user cases in which authentication must be performed for someone who is physically located outside the organization premises.

- Agents, Salespeople, etc. with a **mobile device** who need to access on-premise services.
- Third part contractors who might need to access on-premise resources.
- Individuals who are part of the resident staff of the organization but are allowed to perform **remote working**.

Any of these scenarios has **already** its own solution with traditional techniques which **extend the traditional AD such as Federation or VPN Tunnel or adhoc accounts**. However, in all cases there si **limited flexibility and increase complexity and costs in addition to several technical problems** which mak it hard to set-up, configure and maintain such solutions.

---

The following table illustrates the corrispondence betwenn traditional AD technologies and some of the solution that allow to achieve the same result but are independent of AD and are therefore more scalable.


| AD                      | Open Solutions             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Group Policies`  | Mobile Device Management (MDM) |  
| `Kerbeors/NTML`   | OpenID & OAuth |
| `Session Based Security` | Acess Tokens & Refresh Tokens |

## [Azure AD](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=81397afd-a564-4afd-826d-07968d4f5e4f&clip=2&mode=live)   

**Azure AD** is an **entirely new** product that is **independent of AD**, although it can easily work together with AD.

- It is suitable for the cloud.
- Supports modern Authentication Protocols i.e. OpenID & OAuth.
- Provides **SDKs for almost any platform**.
- Supports **B2C, B2B and B2E** authentication.
- There are numerous SaaS Applications that integrate with Azure AD already available on teh marketplace.

### [Azure AD Connect](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=81397afd-a564-4afd-826d-07968d4f5e4f&clip=2&mode=live)  

[Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594) is a tool that allows organization to easily migrate from their on-premise AD to Azure AD. There are essentially two ways in which such migration can be achieved.

1. AD identities and the Authentication service are both migrated to the cloud. 

2. The AD identiites are migrated to Azure AD but the authentication service remains on premise and AD Azure Authentication **federates the authentication to the on premise AD Authentication Service**.

## [Authentication Scenarios](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=81397afd-a564-4afd-826d-07968d4f5e4f&clip=4&mode=live)  

- Form-based Authentication
- Business to Consumer (B2C) Authentication
- Token-based Authentication to SQL
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Certificate-based Authentication

## [Form-based Authentication](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=1588d422-3e09-4635-96cc-353b5e6bca48&clip=0&mode=live)  

This scenario is the simple case in which a user needs to authenticate to a service through a web form by providing their own AD credentials.

[Form-based Authentication can in general be achieved by one of the following mecanisms.](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=1588d422-3e09-4635-96cc-353b5e6bca48&clip=1&mode=live)  

### [Impotant Protocols](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=1588d422-3e09-4635-96cc-353b5e6bca48&clip=2&mode=live)  

1. WS-Federation
2. SAMLP - Security Assertion Markup Language Protocol
3. OpenID Connect 
4. OAuth2 Implicit Flow - suitable for SPAs
5. Authorization Code Grant Flow - suitable for Native Apps
6. Proof of Key Exchange (PKCE) flow - suitable for mobile apps

| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| mostly for **SSO**        | mostly used for APIs |
| mostly browser            | browser and native apps |
| heaviweight digitally signed large XML | small JSON random token |
| mostly browser            | browser and native apps |
| expensive validation | simplevalidation|
| many security options | few security options |

### [What is Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwWb7S6OvFI)  

- AFDS is an **integrated** **claim-based identity management solution**.
- Provides **SSO** for web applications.
- Send **claims** to a web application **on behalf of AD**.
- helps to **support web service interoperability** between vendors.

### The most common authentication mechanics used by ADFS - SAML 2.0

When a request at the URL of a reource or service is received it replies to the request (from the browser) with a **HTTP 302 URL redirection to the URL of the on-premise ADFS server**.

The **on-premise ADFS server**  receives the **authentication request** from the user's browser **for the cloud service or resource** the user tried to access. It then **authenticates** the user against the **on-premise AD Service** and replies to the uthentication request from the user's browser with **a set of claims for the authenticated user and the cloud resource that the user tried to access** all wrapped-up in a **cookie**.

Finally the user brower is redirected by the **ADFS HTTP 302 response** back to the same URL of the cloud resource or service it wanted to access in the first place but this time it is able to present its **identity and the claims for the requested cloud service or resource**.

### Credentials are never exposed to the cloud 

One of **the most important facts** to keep in mind about the mechanics of ADFS is that users who want or need to access resources or services made available in the cloud are **never** requested to provide any credentials to any part of the cloud infrastructure at the time they attempt to consume those services. **Users are authenticated entirely on premise and any username o passoword** inputted by users in their browser are aonly transmitted to the ADFS Server and then relayed to AD and are kept within the confine of the enterprise IT infrastructure.

### Attributes included in the claim

The **claim-based** cookie that is presented to the cloud resource at the end of the authentication process is **agreed in advance** between the cloud service and the ADFS Server. Claims might be a set of information tokes such as **Firstname, Lastname, email adress, department, etc.**.
