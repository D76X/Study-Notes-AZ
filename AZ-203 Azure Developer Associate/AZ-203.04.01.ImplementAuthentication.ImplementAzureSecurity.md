### [What is Azure AD and why do we need it?](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=azure-active-directory-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=azure-active-directory-developers-m1&clip=1&mode=live)    

### [What are the limits of Active Direcory (AD)?](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=81397afd-a564-4afd-826d-07968d4f5e4f&clip=1&mode=live)  

In the **Windows Ecosystem** **Authentication is implemented by means of the long standing Active Directory (AD)**. However, **AD does not scale well** in all cases that involves actors who might need to authenticate from outside the boundaries of the organization.

These cases have become predominant in all secotrs of industry. The list below shows a sample of typical user cases in which authentication must be performed for someone who is physically located outside the organization premises.

- Agents, Salespeople, etc. with a **mobile device** who need to access on-premise services.
- Third part contractors who might need to access on-premise resources.
- Individuals who are part of the resident staff of the organization but are allowed to perform **remote working**.

Any of these scenarios has **already** its own solution with traditional techniques which **extend the traditional AD such as Federation or VPN Tunnel or adhoc accounts**. However, in all cases there is **limited flexibility and increase complexity and costs in addition to several technical problems** which mak it hard to set-up, configure and maintain such solutions.

**Azure AD** has been designed from the ground up to adress also these problems among others whic are appened in the list below.

### [Problems with AD](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=azure-active-directory-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=azure-active-directory-developers-m1&clip=1&mode=live)  

- Authentications scenarios have gone beyond the simple case of the on-premise user PC with the advent of mobile devices, remote working, cloud services.
- AD represent a single point of failure whithin the organization i.e. if the AD controller went down then there would not be any email, Outlook, Sharepoint, etc.
- On-premise Active Directory si not designed for Internet scale above all because teh main design is based on a hierarchy of trust that does not traslate at all to the reality of cloud services and intergation with third-party services and APIs.
- The amount of information exchanged to teh purpose of authentication between the user's PC and the AD Controller is large and the process is repeated seberal time. While this is OK with the on-premise infrastructure it is not suitable for authentication protocols that must take place over the Internet (public infrastructure). 

### [How Azure ADsolves these problems](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=azure-active-directory-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=azure-active-directory-developers-m1&clip=1&mode=live)  

- Azure AD is designed from the ground up to provide **Authentication Services** **built on standard protocols already in use over the Internet (OAuth1/2, SAML. PKCE, WS-Federation, etc.)** and therefore able to scale in those scenarios.

---

The following table illustrates the corrispondence betwenn traditional AD technologies and some of the solution that allow to achieve the same result but are independent of AD and are therefore more scalable.


| AD                      | Open Solutions             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Group Policies`  | Mobile Device Management (MDM) |  
| `Kerbeors/NTML`   | OpenID & OAuth |
| `Session Based Security` | Acess Tokens & Refresh Tokens |

## [Azure AD](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=81397afd-a564-4afd-826d-07968d4f5e4f&clip=2&mode=live)   

[**Azure AD** is an **entirely new** product that is **independent of AD**, although it can easily work together with AD.](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=azure-active-directory-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=azure-active-directory-developers-m1&clip=1&mode=live)  

- It is suitable for the cloud.
- Supports modern Authentication Protocols i.e. OpenID & OAuth.
- Provides **SDKs for almost any platform**.
- Supports **B2C, B2B and B2E** authentication.
- There are numerous SaaS Applications that integrate with Azure AD already available on teh marketplace.
- It is **completely free** for any organization to use as the **defacto standard for Authorization**, officially with a limit of 500.000 users which can be lifted, for free, if necessary.
- it is the **Authentication mechanism usedby Office 365** and therefore already in place in most organizations.

### [Azure AD Connect](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=81397afd-a564-4afd-826d-07968d4f5e4f&clip=2&mode=live)  

[Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594) is a tool that allows organization to easily migrate from their on-premise AD to Azure AD. There are essentially two ways in which such migration can be [achieved](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=azure-active-directory-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=azure-active-directory-developers-m1&clip=2&mode=live) .

1. AD identities and the Authentication service are both migrated to the cloud. 

2. The AD identiites are migrated to Azure AD but the authentication service remains on premise and AD Azure Authentication **federates the authentication to the on premise AD Authentication Service (ADFS)**.

When the migration strategy is to transfer the AD credential to Azure AD then the **Azure AD Connect** tool can do so by passing the hash of the password stored in AD on-premise directly as it is or as a new hash of this hash. In the latter case AD Azure remains oblivion of the original hash and merely provides Authentication Services on behalf of the on-premise AD Controller.

## [Form-based Authentication](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=1588d422-3e09-4635-96cc-353b5e6bca48&clip=0&mode=live)  

This scenario is the simple case in which a user needs to authenticate to a service through a web form by providing their own AD credentials.

[Form-based Authentication can in general be achieved by one of the following mecanisms.](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=1588d422-3e09-4635-96cc-353b5e6bca48&clip=1&mode=live)  

### [Impotant Protocols](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=1588d422-3e09-4635-96cc-353b5e6bca48&clip=2&mode=live)  

1. WS-Federation
2. SAMLP - Security Assertion Markup Language Protocol
3. OpenID Connect 
4. OAuth2 Implicit Flow - suitable for SPAs
5. Authorization Code Grant Flow - suitable for Native Apps
6. Proof of Key Exchange (PKCE) flow - suitable for mobile apps

### [What is Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwWb7S6OvFI)  

- AFDS is an **integrated** **claim-based identity management solution**.
- Provides **SSO** for web applications.
- Send **claims** to a web application **on behalf of AD**.
- helps to **support web service interoperability** between vendors.

### The most common authentication mechanics used by ADFS - SAML 2.0

When a request at the URL of a reource or service is received it replies to the request (from the browser) with a **HTTP 302 URL redirection to the URL of the on-premise ADFS server**.

The **on-premise ADFS server**  receives the **authentication request** from the user's browser **for the cloud service or resource** the user tried to access. It then **authenticates** the user against the **on-premise AD Service** and replies to the uthentication request from the user's browser with **a set of claims for the authenticated user and the cloud resource that the user tried to access** all wrapped-up in a **cookie**.

Finally the user brower is redirected by the **ADFS HTTP 302 response** back to the same URL of the cloud resource or service it wanted to access in the first place but this time it is able to present its **identity and the claims for the requested cloud service or resource**.

### Credentials are never exposed to the cloud 

One of **the most important facts** to keep in mind about the mechanics of ADFS is that users who want or need to access resources or services made available in the cloud are **never** requested to provide any credentials to any part of the cloud infrastructure at the time they attempt to consume those services. **Users are authenticated entirely on premise and any username o passoword** inputted by users in their browser are aonly transmitted to the ADFS Server and then relayed to AD and are kept within the confine of the enterprise IT infrastructure.

### Attributes included in the claim

The **claim-based** cookie that is presented to the cloud resource at the end of the authentication process is **agreed in advance** between the cloud service and the ADFS Server. Claims might be a set of information tokes such as **Firstname, Lastname, email adress, department, etc.**.

## [Authentication Scenarios](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-authentication-scenarios-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=1588d422-3e09-4635-96cc-353b5e6bca48&clip=3&mode=live) 

The following are all typical Authentication scenarios and for each specific pattern, tools and practices are routinely employed in the IT industry. An in-deapth examinations of all of these scenarios is avalable in the course [Azure AD for Developers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-active-directory-developers/table-of-contents).

- Web Browser to Web App
- SPA to WebApi
- Native Apps to WebApi
- WebApp to WebApi under user credentials
- WebApp to WebApi using the App Identity
- [Deamon/Background Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) to WebApi

## [ADAL - Azure AD Authentication Library](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=azure-active-directory-developers&author=sahil-malik&name=azure-active-directory-developers-m1&clip=3&mode=live)  

ADAL is an open source library maintained by Microsoft.

All the aspects of Azure AD, the traditional AD and ADFS that ahev been discussed so far demonstrate how complex the theme of modern Authentication can be. 

There are typically two sides to take into account.

1. The processes and practices that must be implemented by the IT department to set up AD, ADFS and Azure AD according to the specific requirement of their organization.

2. The knowledge which developer must attain and maintain in order to make sure that the applications, APIs, web and cloud services they develop can properly authenticate by means of Azure AD.

While **the former is strictly dependent on the requirement imposed by the specific organization that intends to make use of Azure AD**, the latter is completely disjoint form such knowledge.

Developer of applications, APIs, web and cloud services or apps do not need to know anything about how the Azure AD Service they must make use of in order to authenticate has been set up in order to do so.

However, on the developer's side the complexity lies in the **multitude of available protocols in which authentication can be carried out between parties and Azure AD**. Such complexity can be appreciated by considering **the cross product between the available protocols and the type of parties**.

This has been already described in above but it is repeated below for 
convenience.

### Typical Authentication Scenarios 

- Web Browser to Web App
- SPA to WebApi
- Native Apps to WebApi
- WebApp to WebApi under user credentials
- WebApp to WebApi using the App Identity
- [Deamon/Background Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) to WebApi   

### Typical Authentication Technologies

1. WS-Federation
2. SAMLP - Security Assertion Markup Language Protocol
3. OpenID Connect 
4. OAuth2 Implicit Flow - suitable for SPAs
5. Authorization Code Grant Flow - suitable for Native Apps
6. Proof of Key Exchange (PKCE) flow - suitable for mobile apps

[ADAL - Azure AD Authentication Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries)  

The Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) v1.0 enables application developers to authenticate users to cloud or on-premises Active Directory (AD) and obtain tokens for securing API calls. ADAL makes authentication easier for developers through features such as:

- Configurable token cache that stores access tokens and refresh tokens
- Automatic token refresh when an access token expires and a refresh token is available
- Support for asynchronous method calls
