## Azure Enterprise Messaging and Eventing

**Azure Enterprise Messaging and Eventing** builds on three core technologies.

1. Queues

Queues are persistence stores to which messages can be sent and from which messages can be read.

2. Relay services

Azure Relay Service covers **the Cloud and On-Prem Hybrid scenarios** in which messages are exchaged between an datacenter in Azure and an on-premise datacenter. **Relay service** is not the only way in which this data exchange can be accomplished in Azure. However, it is a easy way in which this can be accomplished **securely**.

3. Event and Notifications

    - Azure Event Grid
    - Azure Event Hub
    - Azure Notification Hub

This is primarily powered by the **Azure Event Grid** which enables scenarios where consumers can be notified of events raised from within the Azure infrastructure. It is possible to raise either **Azure system events and custom events** i.e. in conjuction to the sale of a product.

# User Cases

## [Queues](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0f9a3869-e136-4df4-9639-c3a3d32ffe94&clip=1&mode=live)  

The main purpose of queues is to **provide a teporary storage** that sits **between** a set of message producers and a set of message consumers **in order to decouple them temporally**. 

Queues are **storage devices** for **heterogenous messages**. Messages with different schema are sent to a Queue provisioned in Azure and **stored** in it for a **maximum specified length of time** and in the order they are received. Consumers can read the messages from the queue **at the time the are able to do so** and draw only those messages which concern them. The queue can be set up to allow a single message to be read multiple times. 

It is offen encountered the situation in which the **rate at which messages are produced exceeds the rate at which consumers are able to process them**. This situation may arise when an the volume of messages being produced exceedes what is the norm or as a consequence of fewer consumers being available to process the messages. In other cases it might be that the time taken to produce the messages is inherently much shorter than the time required to process them and, of course, or all of these scenarios may happen together. In these cases queues can be used to **level out any temporary imbalance** between producers and consumers. 

#### Business Scenario for Queues

A business scenario may be the following. A large business might occasionally offer products on sales i.e. **on Black Friday**. This most likely might **trigger spikes** in sales and therefore in the the corresponding volume of messages sent to the backend consumers. 

#### Traditional Approach 

The **traditional solution** for this business scenario may be based on the following.

- An API to receive the messages
- SQL Server DB or similar persisted store to store the incoming messages.
- A Service that can asynchronously process the messages from reading them from the persistance layer first.

## [Relay Sevices](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=0&mode=live)    

**Relay Services** may be used to connect on-premise services to services in the cloud infrastructure and viceversa.
In other words, any time an organization wishes to send information resident on-premise to their cloud infrastructure and/or receive information from their cloud infrastructure into their on-premise network this can be achieved **securely** by employed Relay Services. The **very important distinctive characteristic of Relay Services over the traditional VPN solution** is that **Relay Services opens up only a single end point in the on-premise netwok and does so without requiring to punch a whole in the firewall of the VNET**.

### Typical Scenario for Hybrid Connection

#### Business Scenarios for Relay Services

#### Scenario 1 - propagation of information from one headquarters to another through the cloud infrastructure
A business owns and manage private IT infrstructure i.e. an on-premise network at one of his branch offices or headquarters. It wants to distrubute some files i.e. HR documentation, catalogs or similar
in a secure way which originate from these headquarters to the other headquarters and branch offices so that they may eventually reach their end users i.e. their employees.

One way to solve this problem inexpensively by leveraging Azure infrastructure is to use the Relay service. The headquarter that act as a source of the files to distribute will send the files to a Hybrid Connection endpoint in azure and the other headquarters and branch offices will then be able to read from the Hybrid Connection EP to retrieve the files. Notice that in both cases HTTP requests are made to the Hybrid Connection EP over HTTP and there is no need to open any port through any of the firewalls for inbound traffic.

Th Hybrid connection is paid per connection but a cheaper solution, when the volume of data is limited, is to use WCF Relay instead, although in this case only the WCF and the full .Net Framework is supported with corresponding SDKs.

#### Scenario 2 - to make available on-premise DB as a read-only copy available on the cloud 

Another similar but typical example is to make available a **SLQ Server from one branch office or headquarters to other**. The mechanism is the same as for the scenario just described only the nature of the data sent to and read from the Hybrid connection EP changes.

#### Traditional Approach 

The **traditional solution** for this business scenario may be based on the following.

- Use an **FTP** service to upload the files once a user has made a changes.
- Once in the cloud a service processes the file.
- Once the files is processed it may be stored to SQL or similar persistence layer.
- Other cloud services have access to the persistence layer thus the updated data.

## Events and Messaging

- Azure Event Grid
- Azure Event Hub    
- Azure Notification Hub

---

## [Azure Event Grid](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0588df39-38a5-4547-a83f-37cbd1350757&clip=1&mode=live)    

#### Business Scenario for EvenGrid

The business wishes to allow users of their software to make updates to their profile.
For example users are allowed to updated their profile image for their account among the others. This data is visible to the whole community this the business wishes to moderate and monitor changes to user account data in order to make sure that appropriate content is used i.e. that user images do not refer to product from the cometition and are appropriate, etc. 

In order to achive this the company needs to be able to **receive a notification when any specific piece of user accaount data changes**. The **notification** may also need to **make use of multiple channels** i.e. **email, sms, telephone call, etc**. **Notofication** might not anly be sent to specific personell but also to **other systems** for example other artifacts withing the company's cloud infrastructure.

#### Traditional Approach - Polling based system

As **real-time** motification system are very difficult to build the most traditional approach to solve to this type of problems is employ a **polling-based** system. For example, a .et Service that polls the user account information from the persistence layer and retrives the metadata about the updated data. **This .Net service** would laso be responsible for **maintaining a list of EPs that must to notified of any specific change as documented in the metadata**. 

This architecture that can of course work is also clearly **hard to maintain** and tends to break the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). 

#### [EventGrid Approach](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0588df39-38a5-4547-a83f-37cbd1350757&clip=2&mode=live)  

**Azure EventGrid** can be employed in this scenario as a **serverless, open-platform, real-time event processing service built-in Azure designed to process notification messages at massive scale i.e. hundreds of thousands item-count and EPs**. It is capable of raising and processing notification between many of the Azure artifacts which in this context can be seen as **EventSources (Topics) & EventHandlers (Enet Subscriptions)**. 

The **message types** that can be raised by **EventSources (Topics)** depend on the specific topic that raises them but there are lots of predefined, built-in types already and custom topics and custom events are also possible. Altough, the types if the events changes they all share a **core schema** and each add to this core schema their own.

---

## Azure EventHub

#### Business Scenario for EventHub

#### Traditional Approach 

Event Hubs are suitable for cases where **real-time data** must be **channelled** and **dispatched** to **multiple consumers** for example for analysis purposes. A scenario is that of a business with a number of stores over several geograpfical areas. 

The business wishes to allow a variety of devices to send diagnostic messages i.e. about sales, visits, employees, premises, stocking levels, etc. These messages collected from all over the several stores  **can amount together to a very large volume of data** which can be **channeled through an Azure Event Hub** and then **consumed** by all sort of **authorized** clients. These clients are set-up so that they know the **Azure Hub End Point** and posses the **the necessary connection string**. 

Cleints connect to the Azure Hub in order to read the messages from it. Clients may be on-premise application which make use of the **Azure Event Hub SDK** as well as **other Azure Artifacts provisioned and managed by the business*** or both i.e. one or more .Net Applications deployed on premise or something like **Stream Analytics** which may be set up in one of the business' subscriptions.

This mode of communication is tailored at

- High Volume of data
- Data that cam be sent packaged in messages of size below 64K or max 1MB
- Situation in which the messages may originate from devices running on a number of platforms
- Situations in shich devices running in different platform need to exchange messages that is send and receive
- Situations where some kind of data agregation on real-time data needs to be performed

## Azure Enterprise Messaging and Eventing Highlights

1. All technologies are desided to work cross-platform

**SDKs for the various platforms and programming languages (Python, C#, Java, etc.) are provided** to enable them to leverage this piece of Azure infrastructure.

2. Setting up Messaging and Eventing may take only minutes.

3. Very Low Cost and High Volume Enterprise messaging.

---

## Difference between Messaging and Events

### Messages

- The underlying technology employs some sort of **polling based mechanism** to check for the presence of messages. This results in a **delay** between the time at which the message is created and the time at which it is read by the consumer.

- The **payload of the message normally is the data** required by the consumer. This makes **messages heavy with respect to events**.

- The **sender** of the message is normally **aware of the nature of the recepient**.

### Events

- The technology si based on a **publish-subscribe** logic. This allows events to be **near real-time**.

- The payloads is normally **metadata** i.e. the location of the data related to teh event and not the data itself that is events are **light-weight**.

- Normally **event sources are ignorant of the subscribers**.

---

## Storage Queues

- This is the earliest Azure queueing technology.
- **Azure Sorage Queues** are **part of Azure Storage**.
- They are **lightweight queueing service**.
- They are accessable wia **RESP API**.
- Message size is limited to **64 KB**.
- The **retention** is **up yo 7 days**.
- Suitable for Azure-to-Azure hand-off.

## Service Bus Queues

- **Part of Azure Messaging**.
- **Part of** the **messages-based reliable messaging platform**.
- Service Bus Queues **exist within the Service Bus Namespace**.
- They offer a **true FIFO processing** solution.
- Maximum message size is **from 256KB to 1MB**.
- It is possible to enable **duplicate detection** on **inbound** messages.
- Have lots of optional enterprise features.
- Provide extensive SDK support for multi-platfrom.
- Supports **in-rder and at-most-once** message delivery.
- Provide **publish-subscribe** model.
- Have **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**
- Have **configurable message expiration**.

## [Topics and Subscriptions](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0f9a3869-e136-4df4-9639-c3a3d32ffe94&clip=7&mode=live)  

- Topics and Subscriptions are **extension features** to the **Azure Service Bus**.
- `The most important feature is the publish-subscribe` paradigm - this is what distiguishes Topics from plain messages on a Service Bus Queue.
- The **one-to-many** paradigm.
- **Message Properties routing** as `Rules & Actions`.

1. Use Azure CLI, Powershell or the Azure Portal to create **Topics & Subscription within a Azure Service Bus Namespace**.
2.`Rules for a Subscription` are **best** created in .Net code or a GUI such as the populat **Service Bus Explorer**.

### The important facts to keep in mind are

1. `Topics` are like any other messages on a Azure Service Bus Queue.
2. `Topics` have additional features in that **they can be subscribed to**.
3. `Topics` can be **sent to more than one subscriber at once**.
4. `Filters on a subscribed the Topic can be set to create rules` to route topics to subscriber based on the properties (but niot the payload) of the topic.
5. `Actions` can be set by subscribers **to adjust message properties** as rules are fired. For example if the filter rule on the topic's property named **OrderStatus** were 
`OrderStatus="new"` an `Action` could be set so that the value of the property `OrderStatus` for the received topic when the rule fires is ret to `OrderStatus=processed`. (This can be easily set up in **Azure Service Bus Explorer**)

## [Relay Service - Hybrid Communication](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=0&mode=live)  

### Highlights 

- Azure Relay Service
- Hybrid Connection (an open protocol based on HTTP & WebSockets for mutli-platform scenarios)
- WCF Relay

---

### [Relay Services](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=2&mode=live)  

The **purpose and design** of Relay Services is to provide **secure connection to on-premise networks** `for` resources locate in Azure. The **aim** is to **establish a bidirectional communication channel between your on-premise network and Azure infrastructure** `without opening any port in the on-premise firewall to allow inbound traffic!`

Another **important fact** about relay service is that it is designed to establish a connection between resources located in the Azure infrastructure nad **a single endpoint in the on-premise netwrok** i.e. a SQL server or some other internal service.

### Relay Services are made of two core components

1. **Hybrid Connections** 

**Hybrid Connection** is a **open protocol** build upon **HTTP & Web Sockets**. It is designed to be multi-platform and supporst many programming languages. 

2. **WCF Relays**

This is a **legacy component** used only for WCF endpoints.

In both cases **SDKs** are available with support for all the major platforms and programming languages inthe namespace [**Microsoft.Azure.Relay**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Relay).

### [What is the difference between Azure Relay Services and VPN?](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=2&mode=live)    

| Azure Relay Services     | Traditional VPN             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| No network configuration  | It requires much more configuration.|  
| EP are scoped to a single port on a single PC i.e. WCF Service or SQL Db | VPN are generally network-wide.|

---

### [What is the difference between Hyibrid Connection and WCF Relay?](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=2&mode=live)  

| Hybrid Connection        | WCF Relay                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Charged per connection that is for the number of listeners as each requires a connection. | Charged per message thus cheaper on low message volumes.|
| Are Http & WebSocket based | Are based on WCF.|
| Have strong multi-platform support | only support WCF & .Net Framework.|

### [Creating an Azure Relay Service](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=3&mode=live)   

1. Create a **namespace** wich must be globally unique inside Azure.
2. Create a **Hybrid connection** or **WCF EP** in the namespace.

The namespace is created within a **subscription & resource group** and the 
**Authentication** is controlled via **Shared Access Policies** set at either **namespace level or connection level**.

- [Demo - Creating a Relay Namespace & Hybrid Connection & WCF Relays](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=4&mode=live)   

The process of creation of a Hybrid connection results in a **Hybrid Connection URL** that is the End Point of the Hybrid Connection. If the Hybrid Connection has been created to make use of Authentication then **Acess Policies** must be created. However, it is also possible to create an EP that allows **anonymous access**.

One option is to **create two access policies**.

1. an access policy to listen for data sent from the EP.
2. an access policy to send data to the EP.

Notice that this guarantees that an **Hybrid Connection** supports **secure bidirectional communication** between Azure and any reource outsite it via a **single endpoint**. As the EP is reacheable over **HTTP** it is not necessary to open any ports through the on-premise firewall.

## [Events with Event Grid](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0588df39-38a5-4547-a83f-37cbd1350757&clip=0&mode=live)  

1. What is Azure Event Grid?
2. Working with built-in Events

- A **real-tine** event processing system built into Azure
- It is desigend to run at **massive scale**
- It is designed to be **multi-platform** end **open** through custom events
- It is **serveless** which means that it is not necessary to provision ant resource and not even configure anything to use Event Grid

---

### Core Components of Azure Event Grid

1. Event Sources    (Topics)
2. Event Handlers   (Subscriptions)

**Event Sources** are **native components within Azure** that are capable of raising events for the Event Grid. It is also possible to **build custom topics** thus send events to the grid.

**Event subscribers** are Azure artifacts that **can be configured to automatically react** to events published by the Event Grid.

### Examples of Event Sources (Topics)

- Blod Storage
- Azure Subscription
- Media Services
- Resource Group
- Event Hub
- IoT Hub
- Service Bus
- Custom Topic

### Example of Event Handlers (Subscriptions)

- Azure Function
- Logic Apps
- AzureAutomation
- Web Hooks
- Queue Storage
- Hybrid Connections! (Relay Services)
- Event Hubs

---

### Type & Structure of Events

- There is a **core schema** for all types of the events 
- A part of the event schema that is not in the core schema is specific to the topic that raises it
- The **data object** is the part of the event schema that is publisher specific

---

### [What to do to get started with Event Grid](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0588df39-38a5-4547-a83f-37cbd1350757&clip=3&mode=live)  

1. Register Event Grid at **subscription level**

On the **Azure Portal** go to **Subscriptions** then **Resource Providers** the serach for **Event Grid** andd click register.

No other configuration is required. Once the subscription has the Event Grid enabled as one of its services you can begin to latch up azure conmponets within that subscription to the Event Grid as publisher and/or subscriber.

### [Custom Apps subscribing to Internal Azure Events](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0588df39-38a5-4547-a83f-37cbd1350757&clip=4&mode=live)  

- [Demo](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0588df39-38a5-4547-a83f-37cbd1350757&clip=5&mode=live)   

---

## Event Grid Custom Events

1. Define the event specific part of schema for the custom event.
2. **Create a Topic** to which the events will be **sent** and which will **raise** the event to notify its subscribers.
3. Add subcribers to the Topic as needed.
4. Foe each subscriber you can determine the **retry logic** and the **action** to take once the retry allowance is exceeded i.e. deadqueueing the
event.

### The Event's Topic

You **must** create an Azure object named **Topics** for your custom events to wwork with. When the Topic is created it is **associated with a HTTP End Point**. It is this EP that is used to send the custom events to. When the 
Topic receives the events at its EP then it raises them for all its subscribers.

This infrastructure is designed this way because the EP of the Topic can be secured by **Access Policy** as part of the Topic. This means that in order to send valid events to the Topic's EP an application must know the EP **and** the **shared acess key** for the EP. Clearly, only the creator of the Topic and/or EP can know and convey this information making the EP secure and derby the cutom events.  

#### Create the Topic

1. Go to the **Azure Portal**.
2. Navigate to **Azure Event Grid Topics**.
3. **Add** a Topic - the filed **DNSName** is tye name of the Topic.
4. You mostly leave the other fields to their default.
5. **Create** the Topic.

#### Add a subscriptions to the Topic

1. Go to the **Azure Portal**.
2. Navigate to the Event Grid Topic
3. **Add Subscription**
4. Provide the **End Point details of the Subriber** i.e. `WebHook, Storage Queue, Event Hub, Hybrid Connection (Relay Service)`
5. Provode an **Event Subscription Name**
6. Create
7. Adjust **Properties & Features** of the subscription i.e. **retry policy**.

#### Send events to the Topic

In order to send custom events to a Topic you can use any of the following.

1. Powershell
2. Azure CLI
3. Net Code
4. Other Azure Artifacts i.e. LogicApps.

#### Send events to the Topic with a LogicApp

1. In the Azure Portal Navigate to the LogicApp pane
2. Select the LogicApp designer
3. Select `New Step` then type in `event` and select the `Azure Event Grid Publish`
