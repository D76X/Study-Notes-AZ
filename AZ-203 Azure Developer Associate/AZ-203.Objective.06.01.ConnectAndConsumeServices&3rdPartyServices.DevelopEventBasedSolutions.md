## Azure Enterprise Messaging and Eventing

**Azure Enterprise Messaging and Eventing** builds on three core technologies.

1. Queues

Queues are persistence stores to which messages can be sent and from which messages can be read.

2. Relay services

Azure Relay Service covers **the Cloud and On-Prem Hybrid scenarios** in which messages are exchaged between an datacenter in Azure and an on-premise datacenter. **Relay service** is not the only way in which this data exchange can be accomplished in Azure. However, it is a easy way in which this can be accomplished **securely**.

3. Event and Notifications

This is primarily powered by the **Azure Event Grid** which enables scenarios where consumers can be notified of events raised from within the Azure infrastructure. It is possible to raise either **Azure system events and custom events** i.e. in conjuction to the sale of a product.

---

## Azure Enterprise Messaging and Eventing Highlights

1. All technologies are desided to work cross-platform

**SDKs for the various platforms and programming languages (Python, C#, Java, etc.) are provided** to enable them to leverage this piece of Azure infrastructure.

2. Setting up Messaging and Eventing may take only minutes.

3. Very Low Cost and High Volume Enterprise messaging.

---

## Difference between Messaging and Events

### Messages

- The underlying technology employs some sort of **polling based mechanism** to check for the presence of messages. This results in a **delay** between the time at which the message is created and the time at which it is read by the consumer.

- The **payload of the message normally is the data** required by the consumer. This makes **messages heavy with respect to events**.

- The **sender** of the message is normally **aware of the nature of the recepient**.

### Events

- The technology si based on a **publish-subscribe** logic. This allows events to be **near real-time**.

- The payloads is normally **metadata** i.e. the location of the data related to teh event and not the data itself that is events are **light-weight**.

- Normally **event sources are ignorant of the subscribers**.

## Storage Queues

- This is the earliest Azure queueing technology.
- **Azure Sorage Queues** are **part of Azure Storage**.
- They are **lightweight queueing service**.
- They are accessable wia **RESP API**.
- Message size is limited to **64 KB**.
- The **retention** is **up yo 7 days**.
- Suitable for Azure-to-Azure hand-off.

## Service Bus Queues

- **Part of Azure Messaging**.
- **Part of** the **messages-based reliable messaging platform**.
- Service Bus Queues **exist within the Service Bus Namespace**.
- They offer a **true FIFO processing** solution.
- Maximum message size is **from 256KB to 1MB**.
- It is possible to enable **duplicate detection** on **inbound** messages.
- Have lots of optional enterprise features.
- Provide extensive SDK support for multi-platfrom.
- Supports **in-rder and at-most-once** message delivery.
- Provide **publish-subscribe** model.
- Have **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**
- Have **configurable message expiration**.

## [Topics and Subscriptions](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0f9a3869-e136-4df4-9639-c3a3d32ffe94&clip=7&mode=live)  

- Topics and Subscriptions are **extension features** to the **Azure Service Bus**.
- `The most important feature is the publish-subscribe` paradigm - this is what distiguishes Topics from plain messages on a Service Bus Queue.
- The **one-to-many** paradigm.
- **Message Properties routing** as `Rules & Actions`.

1. Use Azure CLI, Powershell or the Azure Portal to create **Topics & Subscription within a Azure Service Bus Namespace**.
2.`Rules for a Subscription` are **best** created in .Net code or a GUI such as the populat **Service Bus Explorer**.

### The important facts to keep in mind are

1. `Topics` are like any other messages on a Azure Service Bus Queue.
2. `Topics` have additional features in that **they can be subscribed to**.
3. `Topics` can be **sent to more than one subscriber at once**.
4. `Filters on a subscribed the Topic can be set to create rules` to route topics to subscriber based on the properties (but niot the payload) of the topic.
5. `Actions` can be set by subscribers **to adjust message properties** as rules are fired. For example if the filter rule on the topic's property named **OrderStatus** were 
`OrderStatus="new"` an `Action` could be set so that the value of the property `OrderStatus` for the received topic when the rule fires is ret to `OrderStatus=processed`. (This can be easily set up in **Azure Service Bus Explorer**)

### Creation of a Sorage Queue

- [Demo - Creation of an Azure Storage Queue](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=0f9a3869-e136-4df4-9639-c3a3d32ffe94&clip=3&mode=live)  

1. You can use any of **Azure CLI, Powershell or the Azure Portal**.
2. Must first already have or create a **Azure Storage Account** in whic the Storage Queue can be provisioned.
3. As anything else in Azure the storage account must be part of a **resource group and Azure subscription**.
4. From the **Overview** page of teh **storage account** select the **Queue option** to navigate to the pane where storage queues can be proviion for the storage account.

### How is it possible to interact with a Azure Storage Queue?

1. [Programmatically in your application by means of the **Azure Storage SDK** for your platform and programming language of choice](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/). On Windows set the **connection string** in the **app.config** to that of your **Azure Storage Queue**. 

2. You may use the [**Azure Sorage Explorer**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/)    

3. Use **Azure Logic Apps** which can read and write messages to **Storage Queues**.

4. Use **Azure Functions**.

### Note - which Azure assents can belong to a Azure Storage Account?

1. Sorage Queues
2. Blobs
3. Files
4. Tables

## [Relay Service - Hybrid Communication](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=0&mode=live)  

### Highlights 

- Azure Relay Service
- Hybrid Connection
- WCF Relay

---

### [Relay Services](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=2&mode=live)  

The **purpose and design** of Relay Services is to provide **secure connection to on-premise networks** `for` resources locate in Azure.
The **aim** is to **establish a bidirectional communication channel between your on-premise network and Azure infrastructure** `without opening any port in the on-premise firewall to allow inbound traffic!`

Onther **important fact** about relay service is that it is designed to establish a connection between resources located in the Azure infrastructure nad **a signle endpoint in the on-premise netwrok** i.e. a SQL server or some other internal service.

### Relay Services are made of two core components

1. **Hybrid Connections** 

**Hybrid Connection** is a **open protocol** build upon **HTTP & Web Sockets**. It is designed to be multi-platform and supporst many programming languages. 

2. **WCF Relays**

This is a **legacy component** used only for WCF endpoints.

In both cases **SDKs** are available with support for all the major platforms and programming languages inthe namespace [**Microsoft.Azure.Relay**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Relay).

### [What is the difference between Azure Relay Services and VPN?](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=2&mode=live)    

### Relay Services

1. No Network configuration or setup is required.
2. End Points are scoped to a single port on a single device.
3. Charged per connection that is for the number of listeners.
4. Are Http & WEb-Socket based.

### Traditional VPN

1. Requires more configuration to achieve connection.
2. VPN are generally network-wide.

## WCF Relay

1. Charged **permessage** and not per endpoint.

Hence, they may be more cost effective if there exist multiple endpoints to expose each with low message volume.

2. Cheaper than hybrid connection in some scenarios i.e. low message volume.
3. Only support WCF & .Net Framework.
4. Must use the specific **Relay Binding** to connect the WCF service(s).

### [Creating an Azure Relay Service](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=3&mode=live)   

1. Create a **namespace** wich must be globally unique inside Azure.
2. Create a **Hybrid connection** or **WCF EP** in the namespace.

The namespace is created within a **subscription & resource group** and the 
**Authentication** is controlled via **Shared Access Policies** set at either **namespace level or connection level**.

- [Demo - Creating a Relay Namespace & Hybrid Connection & WCF Relays](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=microsoft-azure-enterprise-messaging-eventing&author=stephen-thomas&name=8b69f14c-2ed2-4889-9a44-3c445ed2de96&clip=4&mode=live)   

The process of creation of a Hybrid connection results in a **Hybrid Connection URL** that is the End Point of the Hybrid Connection. If the Hybrid Connection has been created to make use of Authentication then **Acess Policies** must be created.

One option is to **create two access policies**.

1. an access policy to listen for data sent from the EP.
2. an access policy to send data to the EP.

Notice that this guarantees that an **Hybrid Connection** supports **secure bidirectional communication** between Azure and any reource outsite it via a **single endpoint**. As the EP is reacheable over **HTTP** it is not necessary to open any ports through the on-premise firewall.

---

### Typical Scenario for Hybrid Connection

A business owns and manage private IT infrstructure i.e. a network at one of his branch offices or headquarters. It wants to distrubute some files in a secure way which originate from one of the headquarters to the other headquarters and branch offices.

One way to solve this problem inexpensively by leveraging Azure infrastructure is to use the Relay service. The headquarter that act as a source of the files to distribute will send the files to a Hybrid Connection endpoint in azure and the other headquarters and branch offices will then be able to read from the Hybrid Connection EP to retrieve the files.

Notice that in both cases HTTP requests are made to the Hybrid Copnnection EP over HTTP and there is no need to open any port through any of the firewalls.

Th Hybrid connection is paid per connection but a cheaper solution when the volume of data is lomited in to use WCF Relay instead, although in this case ony .net Framework is supported as SDKs.
