## Undestanding Azure Virtual Networks (VNETs)

### What is a VNET?

A VNET is a **container object** that provides the following services to an **Azure Administrator**.

1. **Traffic Isolation**
2. **Traffic segmentation**
3. **An isolation boundary**
4. **Traffic control into and out of the VNET boundary, between VNTEs, and within the VNET** at several different layers.


### Why do we need VNETs and how we use them?

Normally VNETs are used in conjunctions with VMs in that VMs are placed inside Virtual Networks. Furthermore, **service endpoints** of other Azure resources such as **Azure SQL database**, **Azure AppServices**, **Azure Storage Accounts** can also be **linked to** a VNET.

The resources that are part of a VNET can communicate with each other over **TCP/IP** by means of **private IP addresses**.

**Optionally, VMs can also e configured with public IP addresses (PIP)** which make them available over the Internet. However, this possibility opens up some security issues. There exist ways to overcome this security issues and yet make VMs available over the internet.

### Can different VNETs connect?

Yes, this is possible but **it is not automatic** and **active steps must be taken** to make sure that individual VNETs can communicate with each other.

### Layers and Parts if a VNET

In the traditional scenario of a n-tier application with the classical partitions

 - Web tier
 - Business tier
 - Data tier
 - Management tier
 - Active Directory tier

1. The VNET resource is the outermost boundary of an ecosystem of Azure resources. It normally encompasses all the tiers mentioned above,

2. Azure VMs normally leaves inside **subntes** created within the VNET and it is common practice to create a subnet per each tier. 

3. A certain number of VMs are created and assigned to each tier within their subnet. The number of the VMs within eaxch subnet depends on the specific application and the redundancy that the design requires per each tier.

4. The main reason why VMs are assigned to **subnets** within a VNET is that it is therefore possible to secure each subnet by protecting traffic in and out each subnet. This is possible by means of an **Azure resource called Network Security Group NSG**.
