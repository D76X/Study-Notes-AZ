#### Attack Vector  
A measure how hard is to fabricate the exploits which may depends on whether tools to assist in the design, deplyment and automation of the exploit exist.

#### Security Weakness 
A measure of the surface area available to the attack which in turn depends on two orthogonal factors.  

    1. Prevalence : a measure of the number of potential item exposed by an application which may become targets or doors for the exploit.

    2. Detectability: a measure of how difficult is for the attackers to dispover whether there exist entry points through with deliver their attack.

#### Technical Impact
How serious the consequences of a successful attack may be for the buisness, system or organization that falls victim of it.

## (SQL) Injection

### Typical Strategies to perform the attak

Strings manipulation and injection of query structure from query data.

### Typical Remedies

1. Whitelist untrusted data (expected data patterns or types).
2. Parameterization of statements by separation of the query structure from its data.
3. Restrict persmissions of the user to the minimum necessary inorder to achieve their purpose in each context. This is also known as **Principle of Least Priviledge.**

## Broken Authentication & Session Management (Impersonation Hijacking)

### Typical Strategies to perform the attak

1. **Retrieve secrets from the user PC (system)**    
This may be achieved through physical intrusion of malaware.
2. **Auth Cookie Theft**  
Typically achieved through sniffing over HTTP for example at an Internet Cafe or via Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
3. **Session ID Theft**  
This may happen when the system persist the session ID in the URL as it was in old ASP systems. It could also be logged to file by the web server and be available to whoever have access to the logs.
4. Exploitation of systems that employ **weak credentials**
5. Explotation of system that have a **weak policy on the number of failed logins** attemps before password recovery.
6. Explotation of **Weak Password Reset** 

### Typical Remedies

Normally the **persistence of the authenticated state of a logged user relies on cookies** thus is especially imprtant to **make them secure**.

1. [**Use Cookies with HttpOnly flag**](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly)     
This flag on a cookie **makes it immune to a Criss Site Scripting (XSS) attack** tells the Browser that the cookie cannot be accessed through client side script As a result, even if a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw exists, and a user accidentally accesses a link that exploits this flaw, the browser (primarily Internet Explorer) will not reveal the cookie to a third party.
2. [**Use Cookies with Secure flag**](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag)  
When a Cookie is set with this flag can only be sent over SSL (HTTPS). For example, the Cookie cannot be sent when the user is logged on a public wireless network in a Cafe. This prevents the Cookie and so the session secrects to be hijacked by network traffic sniffer, monitors or proxies.
3. **Decrease the Window Risk**  
By setting a suffiently short time window before the authenication credentials stored in a cookie expires it is possible to decrese the likelyhood that a hijacked cookies may be used to perform an impersonation. The expiration window should be a balanced compromise between security and usability in order not to force the user to repeat their logins too offen.  
4. **Hardening of the Account Management**    
This implies employing **strong password policy, frequent password update, no-reuse password, log-out strategies after failed login attempts**.

## Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

This attack is based on the attacker providing the victim with some JavaScript which is dubbed **XSS Payload**. For example a link on a web page may have a URL with a XSS Payload.  

When the link is cliked **the browser** navigates to the **target web site**. The website that receives the request returns a resource to the browser that has requested it. This is usually described as **the server reflects back to the user the XSS Payload**. The recepient Browser **executes the XSS Payload which when properly crafted may be able to send back to the attacker the information resident in the user's browser such as their session cookies**. At this point the attacker may hold valid authentication cookies for the web site the user was originally directed to which might have been their trusted Bank's website. If the user was logged in on their Bank's website prior to clicking on the crafted URL with XSS Payload then the attacker holds a valid authorization cookie for this user and may be able to impersonate them.

There are many ways in which an attacker may be able to append a XSS Payload to a legitimate URL.

1. Crafting URI links that have the **XSS Payload in the query parameters**.
2. **By a successful SQL Injection on the DB of a site** so that one or more links on one or more pages of the websites whose URL are dynamically produced permanently contains the XSS Payload.  

### Typical Strategies to perform the attack  

### A Simple Example

```
http://www.mysite.com/Search?q=Lager
You searched for <strong>Lager</strong>
```

```
http://www.mysite.com/Search?q=<script>alert(document.cookies)</script>
You searched for <strong><script>alert(document.cookies)</script></strong>
```

### Typical Remedies  

1. **Always validate untrasted data** by using a **whitelist of trusted values and trusted patterns**.
2. **Always encode the output** that is prevent anything like `<script>..</script>` to be allowed as part of the HTML document. When any dynamic content is provided to a web page the server must enocode it i.e. `< and >` as `&lth; and &gth;` and the same goes for other special characters so that the browser will print them as characters. This guideline is also know as **never reflect to the browser untrusted data that has come with the request i.e. within its query string and data that comes from the database**. On this last point it must be kept in mind that the database might have already been targeted by SQL injection and contain malicious script content thus it cannot be trusted and the data returned by it must be encoded too before reaching the DOM. 
3. Use encoding libraries do not try to do the encoding yourself.

## Cross SiteRequest Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)

#### An Example of XSRF/CSRF

You might go to a banking website and provide some credentials to log into your account. Your **credenitals is stored in a secure browser cookie i.e. a session cookies** for a certain period of time so the bank can tell you are still logged in instead of having you login another time with each page you access. 

Later on, you go to an innocent-seeming webpage listing some facts about bunnies. Unbeknownst to you, the webpage’s HTML also has a little Javascript script to make an AJAX request (see: XMLHttpRequest) to the previous banking website to make a wire transaction to another account **POST/PUT** or retrive bank accountdetails **GET** that can ultimately then be sent to the attacker's domain. 

Because your session is still authenticated with the cookie that was stored earlier, the banking website thinks it’s just you clicking on a link on their site to submit a wire transaction. 

### Typical Strategies to perform the attack  

1. Social engineering in general that is crafting links to malicious websites and inducing victims to click on the crafted links to direct users to the attacker's domain.
