#### Attack Vector  
A measure how hard is to fabricate the exploits which may depends on whether tools to assist in the design, deplyment and automation of the exploit exist.

#### Security Weakness 
A measure of the surface area available to the attack which in turn depends on two orthogonal factors.  

    1. Prevalence : a measure of the number of potential item exposed by an application which may become targets or doors for the exploit.

    2. Detectability: a measure of how difficult is for the attackers to dispover whether there exist entry points through with deliver their attack.

#### Technical Impact
How serious the consequences of a successful attack may be for the buisness, system or organization that falls victim of it.
