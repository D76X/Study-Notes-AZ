Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service
Service to manage Identity
helps your employees sign in and access resources
External resources, such as Microsoft Office 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications
Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network and intranet, along with any cloud apps developed by your own organization.
Designed for Internet Scale (OAuth) & Open Internet Standards (REST)
It's free (basic)

Add a User to a Directory

An Azure subscription has a trust relationship with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which means that the 
subscription trusts Azure AD to authenticate users, services, and devices. Multiple subscriptions can trust 
the same Azure AD directory, but each subscription can only trust a single directory. All of your users have a 
single home directory for authentication. However, your users can also be guests in other directories. 
You can see both the home and guest directories for each user in Azure AD.

1. Cryptographic Keys i.e. those used in Always Encrypted Azure SQL Server or Azure Storage Encryption at Rest these keys are used to encrypt and decrypt teh data
2. Secrets that is any sensitive information i.e. connection string, passwords, storage connection strings, client secrets, etc.
3. Certificates x509 certificates used in establishing SSL communication. Both the PBK and PRK must be stored securely.

What is Microsoft Azure Key Vault?

The Role of Azure AD with Azure Services & Key Vault

Register a ServiceApp with AzureAD to access a KeyVault in order to read Secrets
On Registering the Service App gets a ClientID & Client Secret back i.e. the ID and The Key from the Anology of the Bank

1. Centralized Management i.e. Grant/Revoke all in the same place
2. Auditing and Logging is built in
3. Rotation and Versioning of keys and secrets

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/vs-secure-secret-appsettings
1. Create a KeyVault (with PowerShell?)
2. Store a connection string to the KeyVault and remome it from the web.config
3. Register an application with Azure AD to get ClientID and Client Seecret (Cleint Key)
4. Configure the App to reach the KeyVault

Notice that out of this process you get 

When the KeyVault is created
1.the ID of the resource created in the KeyVault
2.the name of the KeyVault

When you register the App on Azure AD
3.The ClientID(=ApplicationID) 
4.The Cleint Secrets - a key that you can create for that app on Azure AD with a set Expiration and that can be Revoked at any time

When you set up the App to talk to KeyVault
1. First you set up the KeyVault so that it knows that it can talk to the app with the given ApplicationId from above

When you ste the App.Config now you replace the original connection string with three pieces of info
1. ClientID
2. ClientSecret
3. The name of teh key to read from teh keyvault and its URL
