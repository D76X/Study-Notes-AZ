1. Create a KeyVault (with PowerShell?)
2. Store a connection string to the KeyVault and remome it from the web.config
3. Register an application with Azure AD to get ClientID and Client Seecret (Cleint Key)
4. Configure the App to reach the KeyVault

Notice that out of this process you get 

When the KeyVault is created
1.the ID of the resource created in the KeyVault
2.the name of the KeyVault

When you register the App on Azure AD
3.The ClientID(=ApplicationID) 
4.The Cleint Secrets - a key that you can create for that app on Azure AD with a set Expiration and that can be Revoked at any time

When you set up the App to talk to KeyVault
1. First you set up the KeyVault so that it knows that it can talk to the app with the given ApplicationId from above

When you ste the App.Config now you replace the original connection string with three pieces of info
1. ClientID
2. ClientSecret
3. The name of teh key to read from teh keyvault and its URL
