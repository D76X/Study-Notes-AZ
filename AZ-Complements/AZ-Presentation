An Azure subscription has a trust relationship with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which means that the 
subscription trusts Azure AD to authenticate users, services, and devices. Multiple subscriptions can trust 
the same Azure AD directory, but each subscription can only trust a single directory. All of your users have a 
single home directory for authentication. However, your users can also be guests in other directories. 
You can see both the home and guest directories for each user in Azure AD.

Associate or add an Azure subscription to your Azure Active Directory tenant

1. Cryptographic Keys i.e. those used in Always Encrypted Azure SQL Server or Azure Storage Encryption at Rest these keys are used to encrypt and decrypt teh data
2. Secrets that is any sensitive information i.e. connection string, passwords, storage connection strings, client secrets, etc.
3. Certificates x509 certificates used in establishing SSL communication. Both the PBK and PRK must be stored securely.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/vs-secure-secret-appsettings
1. Create a KeyVault (with PowerShell?)
2. Store a connection string to the KeyVault and remome it from the web.config
3. Register an application with Azure AD to get ClientID and Client Seecret (Cleint Key)
4. Configure the App to reach the KeyVault

Notice that out of this process you get 

When the KeyVault is created
1.the ID of the resource created in the KeyVault
2.the name of the KeyVault

When you register the App on Azure AD
3.The ClientID(=ApplicationID) 
4.The Cleint Secrets - a key that you can create for that app on Azure AD with a set Expiration and that can be Revoked at any time

When you set up the App to talk to KeyVault
1. First you set up the KeyVault so that it knows that it can talk to the app with the given ApplicationId from above

When you ste the App.Config now you replace the original connection string with three pieces of info
1. ClientID
2. ClientSecret
3. The name of teh key to read from teh keyvault and its URL
